# Authentication Configuration

NextEasy uses NextAuth.js for authentication, providing a flexible and secure system for user management. This guide will help you configure and customize the authentication system to fit your project's needs.

## Basic Configuration

NextEasy uses NextAuth for authentication. The main configuration is located in `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. To update or add a new provider, follow these steps:

1. Open `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/authOptions.ts` in the root directory
2. Update the `providers` array with your authentication providers
3. Update the `callbacks` object to customize token / session behavior
4. Modify `/types/next-auth.d.ts` if you need to add new properties to the user object

## Available Providers

By default, NextEasy includes the following authentication provider:
- Email/Password (Credentials)

To add more providers, such as Google or GitHub, you'll need to install the respective packages and add them to the `providers` array in the configuration file.

## Customizing Authentication

### Adding a New Provider

To add a new authentication provider, such as Google OAuth, just go to the [NextAuth website](https://next-auth.js.org/providers) and search for the provider you want to add.

Then, copy and paste the code for the provider you want to add.

ps: You can also customize the provider to your needs.
