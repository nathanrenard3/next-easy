# Stripe Configuration

NextEasy comes with built-in Stripe integration for handling payments and subscriptions. This guide will help you set up and customize the Stripe configuration for your project.

## Setting Up Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account if you haven't already at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com).
2. Obtain your Stripe API keys from the Stripe Dashboard.
3. During the setup process (`npm run setup`), you'll be prompted to enter your Stripe Secret Key. This will be stored in your `.env` file.

## Configuring Stripe Products and Prices

To set up Stripe products and prices:

1. Open `config.ts` in the root directory
2. Locate the `stripe.products` array
3. Update each product with your Stripe Price ID, name, description, price (in cents), and features.

ps: You can find the price ID in the Stripe Dashboard.
