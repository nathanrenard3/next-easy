# Shadcn UI Configuration

NextEasy uses Shadcn UI for its component library, which is built on top of Tailwind CSS. This guide will help you customize the theme and add new components.

## Customizing the Theme

The global styles for Shadcn UI are defined in `/styles/globals.css`. This file contains CSS variables that control the theme of your application.

To modify the theme:

1. Open `/styles/globals.css`
2. Locate the `:root` selector for light mode and `.dark` for dark mode
3. Adjust the CSS variables to change colors, fonts, or other design elements

ps: You can choose your theme [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes)

## Adding New Components

To add a new component, just go to the [shadcn website](https://ui.shadcn.com/components) and search for the component you want to add.
