## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanrenard3/next-easy.git
cd next-easy
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set up the environment variables

Run the setup script to configure your environment variables:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This script will guide you through setting up:
- Database configuration
- Stripe integration
- Email settings
- Authentication secrets

The script will ask you to provide:
- Database URLs
- Stripe API keys
- Resend API key for email
- Base URL for your application
- Email addresses for development testing

After completion, the script will create a `.env` file in the root of your project with all necessary variables.

### Seed the database

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will create a new user in the database with the email `admin@nexteasy.fr` and the password `admin-password111!` (use it to login only in development).
