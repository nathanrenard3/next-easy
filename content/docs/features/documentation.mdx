## Creating Your Own Documentation

NextEasy provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage your project's documentation. This guide will walk you through the process of adding and organizing your documentation.

## Directory Structure

Your documentation files should be placed in the `content/docs` directory. The structure of this directory determines the organization of your documentation. Here's an example structure:

```
content/docs
├── getting-started
│   ├── index.mdx
│   ├── advanced-configuration
│   │   ├── shadcn.mdx
│   │   ├── authentication.mdx
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── features
│   ├── index.mdx
│   ├── documentation.mdx
│   └── ...
```

## Writing Documentation

1. Create `.mdx` file in the directory you want to add the documentation to.
2. Each `.mdx` file should start with a frontmatter section that includes metadata about the document. For example:

```
---
title: "My Documentation"
description: "This is a sample documentation"
position: 1
---
```

The `title` is used as the page title, the `description` is used as the page description, and the `position` is used to sort the page in the sidebar.
